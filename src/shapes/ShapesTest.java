Test your code by creating a new class, ShapesTest (also inside of shapes) with a main method. Inside the main method,

-create a variable of the type Rectangle named box1 and assign it a new instance of the
Rectangle class with a width of 4 and a length of 5

-verify that the getPerimeter and getArea methods return 18 and 20, respectively.

-create a variable of the type Rectangle named box2 and assign it a new instance of the Square class that has a side value of 5.

-verify that the getPerimeter and getArea methods return 20 and 25, respectively.
